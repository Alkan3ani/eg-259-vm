      Part 5: Creating the Cars Application
    </h2>
    <p>
This fifth and final screencast in the series on <em>Web Applications Development using Ruby on Rails</em> shows you how we can link the database created in Part 4 to the web. The presentation demonstrates how Rails' support for useful defaults can make trivial the creation of an outline CRUD application based on the <em>Model-View-Controller</em> pattern. We'll also see that Rails uses another software design pattern called <em>Active Record</em> to tie models, represented by Ruby classes, to the database tables. It also provides a feature called scaffolding that automatically creates controllers and views (web pages) used to connect models to the web.
